Hi Github!

Victor here, i'm new to coding and Github and want to learn more and explore different languages to code in and see how they function and allow you how to use them.

I will be learing a lot from the already extensive catalog of code/issues and answers.

Thank you for all the help in advance!

Greetings, Victor.
